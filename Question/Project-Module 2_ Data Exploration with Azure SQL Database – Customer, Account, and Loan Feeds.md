# Project Title: Data Exploration with Azure SQL Database â€“ Customer, Account, and Loan Feeds

## Objective:

Trainees will explore and manipulate multiple related datasets using Azure SQL Database. The focus will be on organizing the datasets, identifying data types, and exploring their relationships and contents.

## Tools Required:

\- Azure SQL Database  
\- SQL Management tools (Azure Data Studio or SQL Server Management Studio)  
\- Dataset \- [https://kaggle.com/datasets/9234c6c4d25b6eb7c3dbb15a0e33d65ae68a405d42acba8db1248defee7aff9c](https://kaggle.com/datasets/9234c6c4d25b6eb7c3dbb15a0e33d65ae68a405d42acba8db1248defee7aff9c)  
\- GitHub

## Project Tasks:

### 1\. Setting Up Azure SQL Database

   \- Step 1.1: Create an Azure SQL Database in the Azure portal.  
     \- Define a new database and server.  
   \- Step 1.2: Name the database \`CustomerAccountLoanDB\`.

### 2\. Data Organization

   \- Step 2.1: Create tables for the provided feeds:  
     \- Customer Feed:

| CREATE TABLE customers (           customer\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,           first\_name VARCHAR(50),           last\_name VARCHAR(50),           address VARCHAR(100),           city VARCHAR(50),           state VARCHAR(50),           zip VARCHAR(20)       ); |
| :---- |

     \- Account Feed:

|        CREATE TABLE accounts (           account\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,           customer\_id INT,           account\_type VARCHAR(50),           balance DECIMAL(10, 2),           FOREIGN KEY (customer\_id) REFERENCES customers(customer\_id)       ); |
| :---- |

     \- Transaction Feed:

|        CREATE TABLE transactions (           transaction\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,           account\_id INT,           transaction\_date DATE,           transaction\_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),           transaction\_type VARCHAR(50),           FOREIGN KEY (account\_id) REFERENCES accounts(account\_id)       ); |
| :---- |

     \- Loan Feed:

|        CREATE TABLE loans (           loan\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,           customer\_id INT,           loan\_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),           interest\_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),           loan\_term INT,           FOREIGN KEY (customer\_id) REFERENCES customers(customer\_id)       ); |
| :---- |

     \- Loan Payment Feed:

|        CREATE TABLE loan\_payments (           payment\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,           loan\_id INT,           payment\_date DATE,           payment\_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),           FOREIGN KEY (loan\_id) REFERENCES loans(loan\_id)       ); |
| :---- |

### 3\. Data Insertion

   \- Step 3.1: Populate tables with sample data using \`INSERT INTO\` statements for each table.  
   \- Step 3.2: Ensure data consistency and relationships, ensuring each foreign key points to valid primary keys.  
Data available @ [https://kaggle.com/datasets/9234c6c4d25b6eb7c3dbb15a0e33d65ae68a405d42acba8db1248defee7aff9c](https://kaggle.com/datasets/9234c6c4d25b6eb7c3dbb15a0e33d65ae68a405d42acba8db1248defee7aff9c)

### 4\. Data Exploration

   \- Step 4.1: Write query to retrieve all customer information:  
   \- Step 4.2: Query accounts for a specific customer:  
   \- Step 4.3: Find the customer name and account balance for each account  
   \- Step 4.4: Analyze customer loan balances:  
   \- Step 4.5: List all customers who have made a transaction in the 2024-03

### 5\. Aggregation and Insights

   \- Step 5.1: Calculate the total balance across all accounts for each customer:  
   \- Step 5.2: Calculate the average loan amount for each loan term:  
   \- Step 5.3: Find the total loan amount and interest across all loans:  
   \- Step 5.4: Find the most frequent transaction type  
   \- Step 5.5: Analyze transactions by account and transaction type:

### 6\. Advanced Analysis

   \- Step 6.1: Create a view of active loans with payments greater than $1000:  
   \- Step 6.2: Create an index on \`transaction\_date\` in the \`transactions\` table for performance optimization:

## Deliverables:

\- A SQL script with the table creation and queries for data exploration.  
\- Screenshots of the queries and their results.  
\- Upload the SQL file (query.sql) and the document to GitHub.
